This software is used to find phase equilibrium point pairs in the chemimal potential sequentially-ordered dataset output by DFT program based on Equition of State in generation order.<br/>
<h4>STEP 1. Prepare the data file which contains at least two columns of chemical potentials.</h4>
<h4>STEP 2. Set the following parameters in main.m file.</h4>
- fp: filepath of dataset plain file in which data are separated by comma<br/>
- epsilon: distance error threshold of chemical potential pairs <br/>
- kappa: display the scatter plot if true
<h4>STEP 3. Run main.m.</h4>
