STEP 1. Prepare the data file which contains at least two columns of chemical potentials.
STEP 2. Set the following parameters in main.m file.
- fp: filepath of dataset plain file in which data are separated by comma
- epsilon: distance error threshold of chemical potential pairs 
- omega: neighbor radius of chemical potential pairs
- delta: minimal interval of indices of chemical potential pairs in the data sequence
- kappa: display switch 
STEP 3. Run main.m.
